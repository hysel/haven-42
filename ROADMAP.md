  - `logging.md`
  - `security.md`
  - `performance.md`
- Implement core prompts. Done:
  - `repository-discovery.md`
  - `implementation-plan.md`
  - `code-review.md`
  - `bug-investigation.md`
  - `security-review.md`
- Define primary agents. Done:
  - `senior-engineer.md`
  - `architect.md`
  - `security-engineer.md`
- Implement core templates. Done:
  - `Architecture.md`
  - `SecurityReview.md`

- Statically validate local config file references. Done.
- Validate the pack in Continue CLI. Done.
- Validate model-backed prompt execution with Ollama. Done.
- Add example outputs for major workflows. Done.

Exit criteria:

- Continue can load the pack.
- A user can run repository discovery, implementation planning, code review, bug investigation, security review, architecture review, performance review, and documentation workflows.
- A user can run AI framework self-review, refactoring planning, product-management review, and release-readiness workflows.
- Rules and prompts are consistent with this repository's style guide.
- README instructions match tested behavior.

## Milestone 2: Enterprise Review Depth

Goal: Improve the quality and coverage of review workflows.

Scope:

- Add architecture review and performance review prompts. Done.
- Complete reviewer, performance, documentation, and product-manager agents. Done.
- Expand SonarQube guidance. Done.
- Add example review outputs. Done.
- Add validation checklists for prompt and rule changes. Done.
- Add decision records for major design choices. Done.

Exit criteria:

- Review outputs are consistent across architecture, security, code, and performance workflows.
- SonarQube findings can be incorporated manually in a documented way.
- The pack has examples that demonstrate expected usage.
- Prompt and rule changes have documented validation checklists.

## Milestone 3: Tooling And Integration

Goal: Connect the pack to richer repository and quality-system context.

Scope:

- Evaluate MCP servers for repository, filesystem, GitHub, issue tracking, and quality data. Done.
- Define a supported MCP integration path. Done.
- Explore SonarQube integration options. Done.
- Add troubleshooting documentation. Done.
- Add compatibility notes for Continue versions and local model choices. Done.

Exit criteria:

- Integration paths are documented and reproducible.
- MCP support has clear setup instructions.
- SonarQube usage is no longer only conceptual.

## Release Hardening: 0.1.3

Goal: Prepare the repository for repeatable release validation and external contribution.

Scope:

- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Done.
- Add release tagging guidance. Done.
- Add sample review fixtures. Done.
- Add validation automation. Done.
- Update pack version to `0.1.3`. Done.
- Remove completed license work from the backlog. Done.

Exit criteria:

- Release process is documented.
- A validation script can check core repository invariants.
- Sample fixtures are sanitized and reusable.
- Changelog records version `0.1.3`.
- The pack configuration version is `0.1.3`.

## Backlog

## Milestone 4: Runtime Validation And CI

Goal: Validate the pack continuously and exercise it against realistic repositories and review inputs.

Scope:

- Add CI automation for `scripts/validate-pack.ps1`. Done.
- Validate the pack against additional real repositories.
- Add more sample fixtures for security, performance, and release-readiness workflows.
- Add project-specific MCP examples after real-world validation.
- Record runtime validation results in repository documentation.

Exit criteria:

- CI runs validation on pushes and pull requests.
- Runtime validation gaps are documented.
- Additional fixtures cover the highest-value review workflows.
- Optional MCP examples are based on validated usage, not assumptions.

## Backlog

- Add cross-platform validation script parity if PowerShell becomes a contributor barrier.
- Add project-specific MCP examples after real-world validation.
